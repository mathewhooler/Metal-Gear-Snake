# Metal-Gear-Snake

## Description

Metal Gear Snake is my take on the classic snake game that so many might remember from their old Nokia Phones.
I have put a twist on the look of the game inspired by one of my all time favourite Playstation games "Metal Gear Solid".

## Getting Started: 
The game operates with the simple use of the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the snake around the board. The aim is to collect 10 "rations" with each collection the snake gets faster. The player cannot touch the walls of the gameboard nor can the snake ever touch itself.


## Planned Future Enhancements.
For future version of the game I would like to implement a change in the snake movement so that the Snake will be able to pass through the game walls and appear on the opposite side of the wall it goes through.
I also would add different difficulty level where the speed of the snake varies.
